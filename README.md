File System Simulator
This project is a simple File System Simulator (FSS) built using C/C++ on a Linux-based system.

The simulator mimics basic file operations similar to those found in Unix-like operating systems, allowing users to manage files through a command-line interface (CLI).

Features


Basic File Operations: create, delete, rename, copy, move, list, and view file contents.


Directory Management: Create and remove directories.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Interact with the file system through terminal commands.


File Permissions: Set and modify file permissions using commands similar to chmod.


Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for invalid operations.

Approach

The project simulates a file system where users can interact with files and directories through predefined commands. 

Each command manipulates in-memory data structures that represent files and directories.

Key Concepts:

File Management:

Each file is represented by a data structure containing file name, size, permissions, and content. 

The simulator mimics operations like ls, cp, mv, rm, and cat.

Directory Management: 

Directories are handled using a tree-like structure.
Each directory can contain files or subdirectories.


Permissions: 
The project implements a basic permissions system using user, group, and other permissions for each file (read, write, execute).


Process Handling:

Forking processes are used to simulate how the system would handle multiple commands concurrently.


How It Works:

Command Execution: 
The user inputs commands like create, delete, rename, etc., into the CLI. 
The program parses the input and maps it to the corresponding file system operation.

Filesystem Simulation: The simulator maintains an in-memory representation of the file system.

Files and directories are stored in structs that hold relevant information like names, sizes, permissions, and links.

Permissions: 
Users can set permissions for files, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify files.

Commands Implemented:

create [filename]: Creates a new file.

delete [filename]: Deletes a specified file.

rename [oldname] [newname]: Renames a file.

cp [source] [destination]: Copies a file.

mv [source] [destination]: Moves or renames a file.

ls: Lists all files in the current directory.

cat [filename]: Displays the contents of a file.

chmod [permissions] [filename]: Changes the permissions of a file.

exit: Exits the simulator.

Future Improvements:


Recursive Directory Listing: 
Implement recursive listing of directories with ls -R.

Advanced Permissions: Include support for setting more complex file permissions, similar to Unix.
Error Handling:

Improve the error handling mechanism for invalid operations and incorrect input formats.

Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/File-System-Simulator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd File-System-Simulator
Compile the code:

bash
Copy
Edit
make
Run the simulator:

bash
Copy
Edit
./fss
Usage Example
Hereâ€™s a simple workflow you can try once the simulator is running:

bash
Copy
Edit
create file1.txt
ls
cat file1.txt
chmod 777 file1.txt
rename file1.txt file2.txt
ls
delete file2.txt


Additional Notes:

The simulator is designed to be simple and lightweight for educational purposes.

It operates entirely in memory, and changes are not persistent between sessions.

You can exit the simulator at any time by typing exit.
